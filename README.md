# Unity_Cubeathon
Unity Game, Cubeathon where you dodge obstacles to complete the level

This game was created to help me learn more about C#, GUI Components, and of course Unity engine. This is not complete as I will still be adding new components to the game.
The game was created with the help of Brackeys tutorials.
This game was also created during the covid-19 quarintine to help me to continue to learn.
